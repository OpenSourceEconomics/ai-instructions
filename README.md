# AI Instructions

Common coding standards and guidelines for AI coding agents, derived from the
[Effective Programming Practices for Economists](https://effective-programming-practices.vercel.app/)
course.

## Purpose

This repository provides a unified set of instructions for AI coding agents working
across multiple projects. The goal is to ensure consistent code quality, style, and best
practices regardless of which project an AI agent is assisting with.

## Usage

Reference `CLAUDE.md` in your project's AI agent configuration to apply these standards.
The file contains guidelines organized by topic:

- **Background**: OS, file systems, floating point, graph theory
- **Tools**: Shell and terminal usage
- **Git**: Version control best practices
- **Python Installation/Execution**: pixi, pytest, pytask
- **Python Basics**: Data types, functions, pathlib
- **Debugging**: Agans' rules, debugger usage
- **Software Engineering**: Naming, testing, error handling, pure functions
- **Pandas**: Functional data cleaning, dtypes, merging
- **Scientific Computing**: NumPy, vectorization, Numba
- **Numerical Optimization**: optimagic, algorithm selection
- **Projects**: pytask, directory structure, reproducibility
- **Texts**: Markdown, README writing
- **Plotting**: plotly.express, graph_objects
- **Machine Learning/Econometrics**: statsmodels, scikit-learn
